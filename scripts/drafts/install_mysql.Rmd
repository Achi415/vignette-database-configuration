# Installing the MySQL Server

1.  Download MySQL Community Server 8.0.31 from <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/>. Be sure to select the correct operating system and processor for your computer. For Macbook M1/M2, it is macOS 12 (ARM, 64-bit), DMG Archive. You can start the download without creating an Oracle Web Account.

2.  Once the download is complete, open mysql-8.0.31-macos12-arm64.dmg. This file can be found either in the downloads toolbar at the bottom your browser window (Google Chrome) or in the 'Downloads' folder of your computer. In the subsequent window, click on the icon for mysql-8.0.31-macos12-arm64.pkg and allow the package to run its program.

3.  Follow the installation steps in the 'Install MySQL 8.0.31 Community' window. At the 'Configuration' step (in the sidebar below), the installer will prompt you to assign a password to an initial 'root' account. Remember this password for configuring your database later. When the installation has completed successfully, you may move the installer to Trash.

4.  To check the installation, open System Settings (a.k.a System Preferences) and click on the MySQL icon at the bottom of the navigation bar. You can see whether the MySQL server is running.

5. Now, configure the path to the MySQL server. In terminal, run

```
ls -a                 # list 
touch .bash_profile   # add .bash_profile
ls -a                 # check that it's there now
open -t .bash_profile # open the text file
```

Find the path to mysql and add the following line to the end of .bash_profile:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/<your_mysql_folder>/bin 
```
